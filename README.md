# SIMULATED CLINIC, OBJECT ORIENTED PROJECT
  
## About the Project  
This Simulated Clinic project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at the Technological Institute of Costa Rica (TEC) during the second semester of my career. The project simulates the operations of a clinic using Java, Swing, and XML, demonstrating a practical application of OOP principles and data persistence.  
The project was a collaborative effort between Isaac Villalobos and Kevin Vega, showcasing our ability to build interactive and functional systems with long-term data storage.  
Any doubts or questions of the inner workings of the project can be made to my personal email: IsaacVillalobosB@gmail.com.  
  
## Features  
Patient Management: Create, update, and manage patient information.  
Appointments: Schedule and track appointments with a user-friendly interface.  
Staff Management: Manage doctors with distinct roles and functionalities.  
Persistent Data Storage: All data (patients, appointments and staff) is stored in XML files, ensuring it remains available between sessions.  
Graphical User Interface: Built with Swing for an intuitive and visually appealing experience.  
Object-Oriented Design: Implements key concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
  
## Technologies Used  
Programming Language: Java  
GUI Framework: Swing  
Data Storage: XML  
IDE: NetBeans  
Version Control: GitHub  
  
## Installation and Usage  
1) Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/IsaacVil/Simulated-Clinic.git  
2) Open the project in NetBeans.  
3) Build and run the project to launch the clinic simulation system.  
4) XML files will be automatically generated and updated during runtime to store all clinic data.  
  
## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, we:  
Strengthened our understanding of object-oriented programming principles.  
Developed an interactive GUI using Swing.  
Gained experience in XML-based data persistence.  
Improved collaborative development practices with Git.  
  
## Acknowledgments  
We would like to thank our professor and classmates at TEC for their guidance and support throughout the development of this project.
